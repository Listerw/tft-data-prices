- other prices in **BULK**
- etc


### Folder Explanation

### Changes

The name of the prices are subject to change, for example if there's any new mods or services made by GGG that conflicts with existing name, we will have to change as well.

The file path are subject to change if there are any channel changes made by TFT. The recent changes being bulk Simulacrum prices changed from `bulk-others.json` to `bulk-simulacrum.json` because new Simulacrum channel has been added due to the changes made this (3.17) league.
